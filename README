The idea for the Library Search Program came to me after a summer working the children's room reference desk at the Buena Vista Library.  I was less than thrilled with the software provided to us to search for books, check out books, etc.  So I began plotting more effective software, that I would develop in my "free time".  Free time?  You wish! said college.  The program didn't begin until I realized I could use it for my final project in CS 230 Data Structures.  And so I did!

The program is written entirely in Java, reading in and creating books and patrons from text files to populate the library.  This will change to books and patrons being stored in databases soon.  Books and patrons are added to hashmaps so searches can be performed by title, author, barcode number, patron name, or library card number.  Results of searches are stored in ArrayLists.  The GUI untilizes Swing, which has (to my surprise) become quite enjoyable to write in.
